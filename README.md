# Hello

Hi, this script was written by n3j / N3jkodem. 
It is a simple script for searching trash cans for empty bottles on the RP server. 
To search the bin you have to use  command /smietnik (Of course, you can change this command to another in the script code)
The script has a vehicle search blocker and is based on dumpster props, which allows you to search almost every dumpster on the map
The script runs on the ESX framework
